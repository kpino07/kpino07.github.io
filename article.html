<h1>Kozyak Minority Mentoring Foundation: Bridging the Gap between Diversity and the Legal Field</h1>

<p>Recognizing the lack of diversity and need for mentors and leaders in the legal profession,
John Kozyak has made it his life’s commitment to increase opportunities and open doors for minority students.
“We continue to lose out on the chance to recruit many promising professionals before they begin their career,” said Kozyak.
“What is troubling is the lack of clarity about why this is happening and until we know why,
we are just guessing at the best ways to help build a more diverse legal profession.”</p>


<p>According to the 2012 American Bar Association’s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), Blacks, Latinos, Asian Americans
and Native Americans now constitute about a third of the population and a fifth of law school graduates,
and make up fewer than 7 percent of law firm partners and 9 percent of general counsels of large corporations.
In major law firms, only 3 percent of associates and less than 2 percent of partners are African Americans.</p>

<p>“By 2042, the U.S. population is projected to be “majority minority,” and no one race or ethnicity will any longer be
the majority in America,” stated Brad Smith, Writer of Microsoft Corporate Blogs. “While America increasingly reflects
the extraordinarily diverse people and cultures from around the world, the legal profession does not.”</p>


<p>Kozyak, a founding partner at the law firm of Kozyak, Tropin and Throckmorton, credits his success in the legal profession
to the strong mentoring relationships he developed with his mentors.  Kozyak believes that mentoring is a powerful tool in
addressing the need to improve diversity in the legal profession for all minority groups and particularly African-American
lawyers. He has passionately promoted diversity and inclusion in the community, with particular emphasis on mentoring programs
for black law school students throughout Florida and in his hometown of St. Louis, Missouri. Earlier this year, in recognition of
his dedication to the community and diversity issues, Kozyak was presented by Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice Jorge Labarga
with the 2015 Tobias Simon Pro Bono Service Award, the highest statewide pro bono award.</p>

<p>In 2002, Kozyak became an active mentor and started a mentoring program to match minority law students with experienced lawyers
and judges in the legal community. The program later evolved into what is now known as the Kozyak Minority Mentoring Foundation (KMM).
Each year the program hosts its Annual Minority Mentoring Picnic (MMP), an event that draws over 1,000 attendees.</p>

<p>During the past ten years,
he has personally coordinated more than 900 black students throughout Florida with judges and lawyers, who serve as mentors.
Although much of Kozyak's early efforts were dedicated to providing mentors for black students, the Foundation's Annual Minority Mentoring
Picnic provides opportunities for all minority law students. The picnic is open to high schools, law schools, lawyers, and judges from all over
the state of Florida.</p>

<p>This year’s picnic took place on Halloween, adding extra excitement to an already fun-filled event. Despite the slight drizzle of rain, parents,
students, mentors, mentees, and guests enjoyed music, a variety of foods, networking and creating lasting relationships with legal professionals.</p>


<p>Mentors and mentees wore an “I need a mentor” or “I need a mentee” sticker on their shirt to identify themselves to other participants. After speaking with
several students in attendance, it was clear that the picnic provides an important mentoring opportunity for the students. “I’m the first one to graduate
from college, so there are no lawyers in my family to give me advice,” stated Milagros Canals, a third year law student at University of Miami. “It’s very
helpful to have the opportunity to meet individuals that can help guide you through the most important stage of your life.”</p>

<p>In addition to providing opportunities for students, the picnic allows employers a chance to meet and recruit diverse candidates
from across the state. Jennifer Maes, Director of Recruiting for the Department of Children and Families, Children’s Legal Services,
has been attending the picnic for over five years. “The picnic is a great way for employers and law students to connect in a comfortable
and friendly atmosphere,” explained Maes. “Our children need a diverse pool of attorneys to represent them and serve as role models.
It helps them see there is hope for a better future out there.”</p>

<p>Amelia Earhart Park, where the picnic is hosted annually, was set up with several white tents and under each tent stood a table representing a school
or organization with display items such as booklets, packets of information to provide to those interested, and giveaways.
However, one tent stood out more than others, having attracted a very large crowd. Amongst the crowd were a number of lawyers and judges in what
looked like a family reunion. Each of these professionals was once or is currently a member of Inclusion: The Path to Unity, a committee within the
Florida Bar.</p>

<p>Dedicated to increasing diversity and inclusion in an effort to have the Bar reflect the demographics of the state, the committee’s mission
mirrors that of the KMM Foundation.The mission of the foundation and picnic has become so well known that it has gained the support of several local and
national bar associations, including the Cuban-American Bar Association (CABA), the Florida Association of Women Lawyers (FAWL), Haitian Lawyers,
Caribbean Lawyers Association, the Gay and Lesbian Lawyers Association, Florida Muslim Lawyers, the National Hispanic Bar Association and many other
voluntary bar associations.</p>

<p>Along with the bar associations, many of Florida’s eleven law schools attended, including University of Miami, St. Thomas University, Nova University,
Florida International University, and Florida Coastal, and more participate not only to establish mentoring relationships, but to encourage students
to network and apply for internships. “When speaking to a first-year law student seeking career opportunities and internships, I encourage students to establish
relationships with programs focusing on diversity,” said Marcy Cox, Assistant Dean of Career Development at the University of Miami.
"Programs such as Diversity in the DA’s Office: Making the Case and the Student Bar Association Diversity Committee: Voices of Diversity.”</p>

<p>The picnic is held every year during the first weekend of November at Amelia Earhart Park located at 401 East 65 Street, Hialeah, FL 33013. Admission
to the picnic is free; however, there is a $10 parking fee.</P>
